The idea of the project is to send e-mails to licensees with overdue reports.  The datasets to be exported from our database is (1) a list of e-mail addresses and (2) the due dates of the reports.  The python script would compare the due date of the report to today’s date and make a determination whether the report is overdue.  If the report is overdue, the list of overdue records would be generated and an e-mail sent with the text “Your report is overdue.  Please send in as possible.
